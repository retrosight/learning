# The Seven Hidden Drivers of Success

Jonathan Fields | Wolrd Domination Summit 2018

What do you want to achieve that will beat your heart louder and faster?

* Define it!
* With your eyes closed, think of something you want to do.
* Think of yourself in the future and the thing is already accomplished.
* Place yourself in it and make it sensory.

Don't just **will** it. **Why** it!

* Why does this matter?
* Why do I want this?
* What is it about this which will allow me to do, be or feel that I do not now experience.

Now...How?

Common approach: Plan and Jam

* Marathon example.
* Me, marathon, eight months.
* Internet: How do I train for a marathon? <-- Looking for the plan, then map. What are the steps I take? How do I reverse engineer this?

95% Failure

It used to be you could find 'The Plan' or find the one person who had 'The Plan'. It's gotten worse. There is plan and process overload. The second we look for it we are overwhelmed with other people's plan and we don't know where to start and we tend to walk away.

Even if you have the perfect plan / process which is proven to work it's likely to fail because the plan is only one layer

There is a lot of stuff that has to happen around the plan. There is other stuff that has to happen behaviorally and mindset wise to find success.

## <a name="plan"></a>1 Plan

How will you get from where you....

```
Actions + Repetition
--------Over--------
        Time
```

What are the actions I need to do every day, how often do I need to repeat them and for how long do I need to do them.

Marathon, Career change, meditation examples.

Things feel more natural over time.

Yet this is where most people walk away.

Meet your life where it is.

When the plan wars against the reality of your life, you walk away.

What does my life look like, where do I fit this in?

Woop

* Anticipate big obstacles.
  * Emotions, beliefs.
* Pre-plan workarounds.
  * When this happens I will do this.

Why don't we pre-plan? We are all a little delusional about our actual lives. We dramatically overestimate our capability and underestimate the time it will take us to accomplish.

* Wish
* Outcome
* Obstacle
* Plan

## <a name="pledge"></a>2 Pledge

We like to think we are pretty smart, evolved beings. Except our brains (patterns, scripts) are running in the background.

Consistency principle: We are far more likely to act in accordance with what we have done or said before. We want to believe and be perceived as consistent.

We like to be consistent.

* Contract
* Declare
* Share

We like to be the type of person who does what they say.

* I commit to take **X** actions
* with **Y** frequency
* for **Z** long...
* so that I can accomplish
* **OHY**!!!

(Oh Hell Yes)

## <a name="people"></a>3 People

The more people you have in your corner the more likely you are to accomplish you goal.

* **Parallel playmate** - the people traveling along with us and aspiring towards something similar to us. They struggle just like you and will do it along with you. The power of these people is commiseration, shared suffering.
* **Accountants** - This is what I'm doing and I am accountable to you for doing. It really helps to have someone outside of yourself to keep you accountable.
* **Community** - Belonging. When we feel like we belong we feel empowered to fail. Shared values, interests, safety. Creates the feeling of 'these are my people'.
* **Champion** - Has a clear understanding of your goal and brings energy to your effort. They remind you of the 'why' you are doing something. When things get hard they become your biggest supporters.
* **Mentor** - A person who is individually accomplished at what you hope to accomplish. They can speak from experience rather than scholarship. They help you adjust and adapt the plan. "You can't read the label from inside the bottle." They help you not bail when you don't have to.

## 4 <a name="possibility"></a>Possibility

Belief precedes action.

If you do not believe the thing you want to achieve is possible it won't be possible.

All you need is to crack the door open a little bit.

Your brain will perpetually ask 'why are you doing this' if you don't believe.

The belief in possibility is the biggest key to unlocking everything.

We don't need complete and utter surrender - we just need a little bit to open up the opportunities.

## <a name="proof"></a>5 Proof

Proof of possibility.

Proof that the thing we want to accomplish is possible.

* People like you.
* People with pedigrees.
* People who are popular.
  * We think being well known is equivalent to being wise. <-- Don't go here.
* It just makes sense.
* Taste of progress.

## <a name="progress"></a>6 Progress

* Counter negativity bias.
  * Our brains spin into the pit of despair more easily than soar into joy and happiness.
  * There is a primal goodness here: It kept us safe when we were cave dwellers.
  * Daily / regular progress counters this pretty well; It is anticipatory.
* Building body of proof.
* Objective benchmarks.
* Regular mechanism.

## <a name="practice"></a>7 Practice

Creating a practice of this entire process.

```
Habit     +  Ritual       = Practice
Automatic    Intentional
```

60% of what we do everyday is habit.

All of the behaviors we've discussed today we want to turn into a mix of habit and ritual.

```
