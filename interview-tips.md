# Interview Tips

## Be your authentic self.

* Be honest about your knowledge level and experiences. When asked a question, answer with what you absolutely know and be transparent about knowledge edges or gaps.
* If you don't know: Say something like 'I don't know, but if you give me some additional information or basic facts we can see how quickly I can pick up on the subject and learn.'
* If you are nervous or feel you don't interview well: Say so.
  * Many / most interviews start with some sort of introduction so you can use yours to note any anxiety.
  * Acknowledging the nervous 'elephant in the room' can help dismiss those fears and help you breathe a little easier.
  * This also serves to help the interviewer level set appropriately and give you both time to settle into the rhythm of the conversation.
* Lean into your natural personality.
  * If you are an introvert: Leverage that strength of listening and being careful with answers rather than trying to (temporarily) project an extroverted personality.
  * You want to be hired for who you are, not a part you play or persona you project.

## Assume the interviewer is an expert.

* Chances are really good the interviewer is very much an expert in the subject matter which they are exploring with you.
* If an interviewer says 'there is no right or wrong answer to this question': This is rarely, if ever, true -- and is a signal you are going to run into an interviewers expertise on a subject matter.
* Always a wrong answer: When a candidate provides an answer that is a different direction from what the interviewer wants to hear.
* When initially answering any question, set a silent timer for 2 minutes (or less). When it expires: Checkpoint with the interviewer they are getting what they want from your answer. Usually the interviewer will redirect if they aren't getting what they want from you.

## Use the word "I" liberally.

* Put post it notes around your monitor to remind you to use the word 'I'.
* We are trained to be 'team players' and candidates often overuse the words 'we', 'us' and 'the team' during interviews. This will often lead the interviewer to questions candidate accomplishments.
* Use 'we' and 'us' and 'the team' ONLY when referring to positive outcomes for the organization as a direct result of your contributions.
* Example: "**I** took on the responsibility for designing and architecting the overall service for scalability and **I** coached the team at large to focus on the individual API endpoints which allowed **the team** to get to market 25% faster."

## Get the names of the interviewers and do some research.

* Find them on LinkedIn and note the following to use as a conversation starter / ice breaker to build rapport:
  * Where you have common experiences; Worked at the same company; Have similar technological backgrounds.
  * If there are experiences in their resumÃ© you know little about and are interested in learning more.

## Understand the decision of 'Hire' (Yes) or 'No Hire' (No) is usually determined in the first 60 -120 seconds of an interview.

* The amygdala region of our brain determines whether or not people are 'safe' very quickly -- within seconds or less in spaces where we feel less-than-safe.
* This dynamic is at play even in completely safe situations -- the timescale is lengthened a bit as we settle into the interviewer / interviewee dynamic.
* Unconscious bias often originates (or is reinforced) with emotions originating in the amygdala. Note: Unconscious bias can be present on both sides of an interview.
* Your job as an interviewee is to give the interviewer as much authentic information as possible to view you as 'safe' to hire.

## Tell your story.

* As humans we are drawn to human stories.
* Make sure the story you tell has three parts: a beginning, middle and end.
* Practice 60 seconds each for each part.
* At the end of the story, invite the interviewer to make a determination to go deeper or move to another subject with something like the following: "Now that I've given you the high level overview, are there any specifics you'd like for me to explore further?"

## Provide specifics in phases.

* An interview approach is to let the candidate go as deep on a subject as they can to see if there is a shift from speaking from direct knowledge to 'making stuff up' (aka: BS or blowing smoke).
* Practice the two-by-x approach.
  * When asked for specifics, provide 2 minutes of specifics.
  * Pause and ask the interviewer if they'd like for you to continue down the path.
  * If yes, give two more minutes of specifics.
  * Repeat X times until the interviewer indicates they have gotten enough detail.
* If you 'bottom out' on your knowledge of the subject matter: Say so and invite feedback from the interviewer rather than speculate.

## Understand you have better odds at literally any gambling game.

* Getting 3-5 almost surely complete strangers + hiring manager (who is more than likely also a stranger) to like you with only a single hour of interaction each: Next to impossible.
* In most cases, it only takes one strongly opinionated 'no hire' interviewer to scuttle the interviewer loop.
* Assuming you are an ethical person doing your best: Any negative feedback an interviewer has about you is 90% about them and only about 10% about you.
  * An hour isn't long enough to get to know a person well, at all.
* The interviewer is having a bad day (or a good one) and you won't know -- and the outcome is based on the circumstances for the interviewer, not how well you did during the interview.
* Net: There isn't much you can control about an interview loop -- so might as well use this knowledge (and these tips) to simply be yourself and "let the chips fall where they may".
  * In other words, simply accept the outcome during each hour of the interview loop without trying to change the outcome.
  * This takes the most zen / patience / detachment from the result. It takes practice AND allows the 'real you' to shine throughout the interview.

## Remember live coding is an absolutely artificial environment.

* Nobody must code, debug, improve, and explain code they write in real time with an audience under an hour.
* Recognize this is a gatekeeping exercise designed to ensure homogeneity within a team or organization.
* 'Be your authentic self' and 'assume the interviewer is an expert' above are helpful tips in these scenarios.
* Ask the hiring manager for the challenges you will be asked to code a few days ahead of time + language expected to give you time to research ahead of time.
* The developer interviewing you in a live coding session is probably looking for these things:
  * Knowledge depth with the challenge subject.
  * Ability to leverage or grasp 'best practice' approaches.
  * Willingness to change course (fast) in response to feedback.
  * Capability in debugging the code.
  * Flexibility in adjusting approach to a better solution.
* Avoid any statement of finality about the code you write.
  * If an interviewer asks 'is this code the best approach' be honest about your familiarity with the problem space, solicit feedback on optimizations the interviewer sees, and invite the interviewer to share their preferred paradigm or approach.
